# Thank You Note

## Gratitude and Reflection

I would like to sincerely thank **GoQuant** for the incredible opportunity to work on the **Back End - Live Strategy Backtester** project. This experience has been both challenging and immensely rewarding, allowing me to push the boundaries of my technical capabilities and expand my understanding of quantitative trading systems.

By the first day, I started learning about these new terms and was little bit worried how I'm going to complete it. Then, first I studied about the different strategies which is been followed and developed the strategies with a particular conditions. I studied and worked for about 8 hours to gain the basic knowledge of the project.

On the second day of the assignment, I started to develop the backtest engine and spent over 8 hours in that and developing scripts and drew a roadmap for things what to be compeleted on which day. I was very happy with my performance for the first 2 days.
I introduced multi assets to the program and then scaled it accordingly.
On the third day, I started working on the Live shadow environment, which I considered was the toughest part of this project. I was suck in the loop of getting the real time data but the strategies were not been running on those candle of datas. 
On the fourth day, I almost lost hope and thought of giving up on this project. But then I studied the strategy again and changed the values and made the data to work on the fifth day.
On the sixth day, I went through the requirements again and added the features that was missing and completed the project.
On the lasst day of the assignment, I made the entire docuentation that was needed to submit and prepared the video and uploaded in youtube and mailed it to the officials.


This assignment was not just a development task — it was a comprehensive journey through the world of algorithmic trading infrastructure, system design, and performance engineering. From handling raw financial data to deploying a full-fledged simulation of a live trading environment, every phase of this project was a learning milestone.

## Challenges and Growth

The complexity of building a **high-performance backtesting engine** with support for **multi-asset strategies** and **realistic execution models** brought out both the best and most determined version of myself. Some of the key challenges I encountered included:

* Efficient **memory management** of large historical datasets in C++
* Designing a **modular and extensible architecture** that cleanly separates concerns
* Implementing accurate **slippage and latency simulations**
* Integrating **thread-safe mechanisms** to support parallelism and real-time responsiveness
* Ensuring consistency across **historical and live shadow environments**

Each of these challenges forced me to revisit core systems programming principles and adopt cutting-edge C++ features (C++17/20), smart data structures, and clean design patterns.

## Technologies and Skills Acquired

This project dramatically accelerated my exposure to new concepts and practical technologies:

* **Event-driven architectures** in trading systems
* Modern C++ (smart pointers, `std::chrono`, lambdas, `std::filesystem`, multithreading)
* **Strategy design patterns** for modular trading logic
* **Risk management frameworks** and trade attribution
* **walk-forward analysis**, and **regime detection**
* Real-world considerations like  **slippage**, and **latency**

I also developed a deep understanding of **financial backtesting methodologies**, performance benchmarking techniques, and **robust logging & monitoring systems**.

## Conclusion

I am truly grateful to GoQuant for this assignment. It has not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of quantitative finance and system engineering. Most importantly, it gave me confidence in designing and building infrastructure that bridges theory with real-world trading simulation.

I look forward to applying everything I’ve learned here in future projects, and I hope to contribute meaningfully to the field of algorithmic trading.
Eagerly waiting for the response.

Thank you once again.
